# Cats-Dogs-Image-classification
In this project I have developed a Convolutional Neural Network - keras model, which classifies images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for this model is taken from  Kaggle. The layers used for the CNN model are Dropout layer, Max pooling layer, Conv2d layer, Dense layer, The accuracy of the model is 88% on testing data. The training data consists of 12500 images 0 minutes per epoch on my local machine.

Required libraries for the projects are Tensorflow, Sklearn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Plotly
